# Characterizing Temporal Dynamics of Visual Perceptual Grouping

When you glimpse mountainous scenery, you perceive the rough shape of the scene. Taking a closer look, you would discover intricate details about regions of bushes and rocks of diverse species. We are exceptionally good at perceiving an image as parts and wholes. Perceptual grouping behavior refines with increasing exposure time exposed to images. While previous studies have suggested the precedence of global over local grouping, how the granularity of image segmentation changes with increasing exposure time remains elusive.

We propose a novel paradigm to study the relationship between visual perceptual grouping with exposure times. We relate the exposure time to computational resources attributed to image segmentation in the Normalized Min-Cut algorithm. This method transfers an image segmentation problem into a graph-cutting problem, thus enabling us to connect computational resources (cut level) with the precedence of perceptual grouping. This allows us to produce image segmentation of various cut levels to probe subjectsâ€™ recognition behavior at different exposure times. Thereby testing the prediction that perceptual grouping goes from coarse to fine with more computational resources.
